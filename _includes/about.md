> Hi,
>  
> I've been building iOS apps since 2009 for various clients and employers. I've taken responsibility in all stages of the application development process: from requirements-gathering and user-experience design, to programming and testing.
>
> I spent the summer 2012 at [HackerSchool](http://www.hackerschool.com) in order to learn Clojure and functional programming. Yet as an outcome of working closely with smart, passionate hackers, I learned something even more important: the value of collaboration.
>
> In the spirit of this experience, I'm now looking to work with and/or:
>
>  - A passionate product team, who:  
>    is goal-oriented  
>    has an opinionated product-vision  
>    is supportive of the development effort
>
> - A small team of hackers, who:  
>    values elegant solutions but ship first  
>    is enthusiastic about collaboration
>
> I'm currently freelancing while living in {{ site.location }}.
